### iDSA (Interactive Data Structures & Algorithms) is an implementation of a node-network visualiser aimed to help visual learners understand their graphs and algorithms better.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this was mainly for me to become familiar with the **3JS** environment, whilst allowing students studying DSA concepts to be able to view and interact with algorithms as they run through. As a computer science student myself, a visualizing program like this would have aided significantly in the learning process. 


## Running iDSA
```cd iDSA
yarn serve"
```      


### Installation with CocoaPods
CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like NSGIF in your projects. See the "[Getting Started](http://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html)" guide for more information.

## Running with own parameters

To simply edit the adjacency matrix, enter your own custom matrix into the textfield at the top of the adjlist. Alternatively, when testing the program, set the field **adjmatrix** to the desired matrix.


## Implemented Algorithms

The current algorithms that have been implemented are the following:

|                |ASCII                          
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Breadth First Search |`"Interactive BFS run throught"`|
|Matrix Generator |`"Draws the graph and connecting edges"`            |
|Dashes          |`"Connecting edges"`|

An example of an *Breadth First Search* being executed on a  12x12 custom adjacency matrix. 

## Running with own parameters
To simply edit the adjacency matrix, enter your own custom matrix into the textfield at the top of the adjlist. Alternatively, when testing the program, set the field **adjmatrix** to the desired matrix.
