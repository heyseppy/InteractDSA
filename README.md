# Interactive Data Structures

This is my implementation of data structures and algorithms using **ThreeJS**, HTML & CSS. This program allows you to input adjacency/matrices whilst watching them work in 3D environments. 

## Motivation

The motivation behind this was mainly for me to become familiar with the **3JS** environment, whilst allowing students studying DSA concepts to be able to view and interact with algorithms as they run through. As a computer science student myself, a visualizing program like this would have aided significantly. 

## In Action:

An example of an *Breadth First Search* being executed on a  12x12 custom adjacency matrix. 

## Running with own parameters

To simply edit the adjacency matrix, enter your own custom matrix into the textfield at the top of the adjlist. Alternatively, when testing the program, set the field **adjmatrix** to the desired matrix.


## Implemented Algorithms

The current algorithms that have been implemented are the following:
|                |ASCII                          
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Breadth First Search |`"Interactive BFS run throught"`|
|Matrix Generator |`"Draws the graph and connecting edges"`            |
|Dashes          |`"Connecting edges"`|
